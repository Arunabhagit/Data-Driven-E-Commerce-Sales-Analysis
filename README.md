# Online  E-Commerce Sales Data Insights & Analysis

 # Introduction

 In the rapidly evolving digital marketplace, understanding sales performance is crucial for making data-driven business decisions. This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to uncover key insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.
Using Python and data analysis techniques, I explored various aspects of the dataset, such as sales distribution, seasonal trends, and customer purchase patterns. Techniques like data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis were applied to derive meaningful conclusions. The analysis provides valuable insights that can help businesses optimize their sales strategies, improve customer targeting, and maximize profitability.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply analytical techniques, and generate actionable business insightsâ€”key skills for a data analyst role.

# Data Cleaning

Firstly, Identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity and avoid skewed analysis.
Checked for missing values across all columns. Numerical columns had missing values filled with the median or mean, while categorical columns were imputed using the mode or removed if they were not essential.
Correctly assinged Order Date and Ship Date  Datatype
Then I created new columns of Year, Day and DayofWeek from Order Date
