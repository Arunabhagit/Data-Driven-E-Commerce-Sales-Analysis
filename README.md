# Online  E-Commerce Sales Data Insights & Analysis

 # Introduction

 In the rapidly evolving digital marketplace, understanding sales performance is crucial for making data-driven business decisions. This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to uncover key insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.
Using Python and data analysis techniques, I explored various aspects of the dataset, such as sales distribution, seasonal trends, and customer purchase patterns. Techniques like data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis were applied to derive meaningful conclusions. The analysis provides valuable insights that can help businesses optimize their sales strategies, improve customer targeting, and maximize profitability.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply analytical techniques, and generate actionable business insightsâ€”key skills for a data analyst role.

# Tools Used

**Dataset**: E-Commerce Store dataset with 9,994 rows and 21 columns.

**Programming Language**: Python.

**Visualization Library**: Used Plotly for statistical insights. Learn more about Plotly https://plotly.com/python/

**Development Environment**: Google Colab for coding.

# Data Cleaning

First, I identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity and prevent skewed analysis. Then, I checked for missing values across all columns. Missing values in numerical columns were filled with the median or mean, while categorical columns were imputed using the mode or removed if they were deemed non-essential.
Next, I correctly assigned the appropriate data types to the Order Date and Ship Date columns. Finally, I extracted and created new columns for Year, Day, and Day of the Week from the Order Date to facilitate further analysis.

The chart highlights key insights into sales and profitability across various sub-categories. Chairs, Phones, and Binders generate the highest sales, but their profit margins vary significantly. Phones and Binders are relatively profitable, whereas Chairs have lower profitability despite high sales. Copiers and Accessories also show strong sales with moderate profits. However, Tables have negative profits despite significant sales, indicating inefficiencies or high costs. Sub-categories like Fasteners and Bookcases contribute minimal revenue and profit.

* Analyze the sales and profit by customer segment

The chart reveals that the Consumer segment generates the highest sales, followed by Corporate and Home Office. However, despite leading in sales, the Consumer segment also contributes the highest profit, indicating strong profitability. The Corporate segment has moderate sales and profits, suggesting stable performance. Meanwhile, Home Office has the lowest sales and profit, possibly due to lower purchasing power or fewer bulk orders.

Sales in the West region were higher due to large states like California and Washington. In the East region, sales were similar in volume, primarily driven by major cities like New York. The Central region also had a sales count comparable to the East. However, sales in the South region were lower due to the absence of major cities. 

#  Strategic decisions  base on analysis
