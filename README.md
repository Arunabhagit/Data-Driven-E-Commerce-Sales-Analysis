# Online  E-Commerce Sales Data Insights & Analysis

 # Introduction

 In the rapidly evolving digital marketplace, understanding sales performance is crucial for making data-driven business decisions. This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to uncover key insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.
Using Python and data analysis techniques, I explored various aspects of the dataset, such as sales distribution, seasonal trends, and customer purchase patterns. Techniques like data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis were applied to derive meaningful conclusions. The analysis provides valuable insights that can help businesses optimize their sales strategies, improve customer targeting, and maximize profitability.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply analytical techniques, and generate actionable business insightsâ€”key skills for a data analyst role.
