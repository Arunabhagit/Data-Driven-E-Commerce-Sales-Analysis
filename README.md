# Online  E-Commerce Sales Data Insights & Analysis

 # Introduction

 In the rapidly evolving digital marketplace, understanding sales performance is crucial for making data-driven business decisions. This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce sales data to uncover key insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends.
Using Python and data analysis techniques, I explored various aspects of the dataset, such as sales distribution, seasonal trends, and customer purchase patterns. Techniques like data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis were applied to derive meaningful conclusions. The analysis provides valuable insights that can help businesses optimize their sales strategies, improve customer targeting, and maximize profitability.
This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world datasets, apply analytical techniques, and generate actionable business insightsâ€”key skills for a data analyst role.

# Tools Used

1. E-Commerce Store Dataset  with 9994 Rows and 21 Columns
  Get the full raw data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunabha9163/online-e-commerce-data-for-analysis
 
2. For Statistical insights I used  plotly Library Function.  Read about Plotly Library from here https://plotly.com/python/
3. I used Google Colab for Coding 

# Data Cleaning

First, I identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity and prevent skewed analysis. Then, I checked for missing values across all columns. Missing values in numerical columns were filled with the median or mean, while categorical columns were imputed using the mode or removed if they were deemed non-essential.
Next, I correctly assigned the appropriate data types to the Order Date and Ship Date columns. Finally, I extracted and created new columns for Year, Day, and Day of the Week from the Order Date to facilitate further analysis.
